PR-03: Wire prompt2flow into generated pack (component + flow changes)
Goal

Only when --prompt is passed:

include component-prompt2flow in the pack’s components: list (or equivalent)

insert a prompt2flow node at the start of the default flow (entrypoints: [default])

ensure that if prompt2flow does “no route”, it continues to the existing first node

Implementation detail

Identify the default flow:

manifest flows[].entrypoints contains "default" (as you showed)

Modify the flow graph:

new first node: prompt2flow

edge: prompt2flow (no-route) -> old_first_node

edge: prompt2flow (route) -> engine route directive (component handles)

Files

generator logic that:

loads/creates flow yaml

prepends the node

writes updated flow yaml

pack manifest logic that adds the component reference

Acceptance

Without --prompt: generated pack is unchanged from today.

With --prompt: pack contains prompt2flow.json and flow starts with prompt2flow.
