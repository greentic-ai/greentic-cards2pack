PR-04: End-to-end tests + fixtures
Goal

Prove this works in one command.

Add fixtures:

a tiny cards2pack input that produces a pack

an answers.json that yields 2–3 intents

Tests:

cards2pack generate (no prompt) → assert no prompt2flow.json, no prompt2flow node

cards2pack generate --prompt --prompt-json fixtures/prompt2flow_answers.json

assert prompt2flow.json exists

assert manifest includes component

assert default flow begins with prompt2flow node

optional: run a tiny “demo runner” if you have one:

send “go: webex setup”

verify routing directive or next flow chosen

Notes / constraints I’m following

No pack routing: prompt2flow routes only to flows/nodes inside the same pack.

No webhooks/auth changes: out of scope.

Minimal risk: feature is fully gated behind --prompt.
